def PrisonersDilemma():
    """
    Return a Prisoners dilemma game.

    Assume two thieves have been caught by the police and separated for questioning.
    If both thieves cooperate and donâ€™t divulge any information they will each get a short sentence.
    If one defects he/she is offered a deal while the other thief will get a long sentence.
    If they both defect they both get a medium length sentence.

    This can be modeled as a normal form game using the following two matrices:

    .. MATH::

        A = \\begin{pmatrix}
            2&0\\\\
            3&1\\\\
            \end{pmatrix}

        B = \\begin{pmatrix}
            2&3\\\\
            0&1\\\\
            \end{pmatrix}

    There is a single Nash equilibria for this at which both thieves defect.
    This can be implemented in Sage using the following::

        sage: g = game_theory.PrisonersDilemma()
        sage: g
        Prisoners dilemma: Normal Form Game with the following utilities: {(0, 1): [0, 3], (1, 0): [3, 0], (0, 0): [2, 2], (1, 1): [1, 1]}

    """
    Return a Battle of the Sexes game

    Consider two payers: Amy and Bob.
    Amy prefers to play video games and Bob prefers to
    watch a movie. They both however want to spend their evening
    together.
    This can be modeled as a normal form game using the following two matrices:

    .. MATH::

        A = \\begin{pmatrix}
            3&1\\\\
            0&2\\\\

            2&1\\\\
            0&3\\\\
            \end{pmatrix}

    There are three Nash equilibria:

        1. Amy and Bob both play video games;
        2. Amy and Bob both watch a movie;
        3. Amy plays video games 75% of the time and Bob watches a movie 75% of the time.

def HawkDove():
    """
    Return a Hawk Dove game

    Suppose two birds of prey must share a limited resource.
    The birds can act like a hawk or a dove.
    Hawks always fight over the resource to the point of exterminating a fellow hawk and/or take a majority of the resource from a dove.
    Two doves can share the resource.
    This can be modeled as a normal form game using the following two matrices:

    .. MATH::

        A = \\begin{pmatrix}
            0&3\\\\
            1&2\\\\

            0&1\\\\
            3&2\\\\

    There are three Nash equilibria:

        1. Both birds act like Hawks;
        2. Both birds act like Doves;
        3. Both birds are equally likely to act like a Hawk of a Dove.
